# Dayary

Dayary is a dairy tool that is different in two ways. First - it can be
deployed as a local web server. Second - encryption is done at the
client side. No one can read your private thoughts even if he gets
access to the server.

## Dairy tools

There are other dairy tools I had used or considered to use before I came to
conclusion I need something different. Here are them:
* Word from MS Office, Writer from LibreOffice or any other word processor
* Blogging platforms like Wordpress or Jekyll
* Moment Diary
* Dairy services online and apps for iOS and Android

## Requirements

And here are what I needed from the dairy tool and haven't found in the existing ones:
* Multiplatform - ability to read and write the diary at least on PC, iOS and Android devices
* Autosaving and autobackup to a cloud storage
* Security - records must be encrypted with strong security locally and decrypted only at the user access time
* Data organization as entries with convenient and accessible view for all entries
* Convertability - ability to import and export entries with the other tools
* Lockable workspace
* Customisable - ability to add features
