## Dayary

Dayary is a dairy tool that is different in two ways. First - it can be
deployed as a local web server. Second - encryption is done at the
client side. No one can read your private thoughts even if he gets
access to the server.

## Dairy tools

Obviously there are other dairy tools. I had used some before I came to
conclusion I need something new. Here are them:

* Word from MS Office, Writer from LibreOffice or any other word processor
* Moment Diary
* Dairy services online
* Dairy apps for iOS and Android

## Requirements

And here are what I needed from the dairy tool and haven't found them in
existing ones:
* one
* two
